<u><b>1.  Writing Code That is Easy to Read, Maintain, and Adapt</b></u>
   
Good code should be easy to read, update, and reuse. In Project One, I created a CRUD Python module to work with a MongoDB database. This module handled Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) actions, which made it easy to connect with the dashboard in Project Two.

Why this was helpful:

Reusability – The CRUD module could be used in different parts of the project without rewriting code.
Easier to fix and update – If something needed to change, I only had to update the module, not the entire project.
Scalability – If I needed to add new features, I could do it in one place without breaking the rest of the project.
How I could use this in the future:

Building a web or mobile app that needs to store and retrieve data.
Creating automated reports for businesses or organizations.
Managing a different kind of database, like one for customer records or product inventory.

<u><b>2. Solving Problems Like a Computer Scientist</b></u>
   
When working on a problem, I like to break it down into smaller steps and solve them one by one. In Project Two, I had to figure out how to connect the database to the dashboard so users could search for animal records.

How I approached it:

First, I understood the client's needs (what Grazioso Salvare wanted).
Then, I designed a system to handle the database operations in a simple, organized way.
Finally, I tested and improved my work to make sure it was working correctly.
How this was different from past assignments:

In older assignments, I mostly worked on small coding tasks. This project was bigger and felt more like a real-world job.
I had to think about both the database and the user interface, instead of just focusing on one thing.
It involved real problem-solving, not just following instructions.
What I learned for the future:

Always plan ahead before writing code.
Test queries carefully to make sure they return the right results.
Write clean, organized code so it’s easy to update later.

<u><b>3. What Computer Scientists Do and Why It Matters</b></u>
   
What do computer scientists do?
They build and improve technology to solve problems. They work on things like software, databases, security, and artificial intelligence to make things run more smoothly.

Why is this important?
For this project, my work helped Grazioso Salvare manage their animal records more easily. The CRUD module and dashboard:

Saved time by making it easier to search for animals.
Made data more accessible so staff could quickly find information.
Helped with decision-making, like figuring out adoption trends.
Overall, computer scientists help businesses work faster and smarter by creating efficient and reliable software solutions.
